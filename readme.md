### Overview
This review focused on identifying and resolving functional, security, and stylistic issues in the codebase.  
All major findings have been addressed to improve stability, maintainability, and compliance with Python best practices.

### Key Issues & Resolutions

#### **Functional Bugs**
- **Mutable default argument (`logs=[]`)**  
  → Caused data sharing across instances.  
   Fixed by initializing inside the constructor (`logs=None`).

- **Overly broad `except:` block (lines 16–20)**  
  → Suppressed real exceptions and made debugging harder.  
   Replaced with targeted error handling for known exceptions.

- **Lack of input validation**  
  → Code accepted unexpected data types.  
   Added explicit `isinstance()` checks for safer handling.

#### **Security Enhancements**
- **Removed `eval()` usage (line 48)**  
  → Eliminated risk of arbitrary code execution.  
   Replaced with controlled parsing logic.

- **Unsafe file I/O operations (lines 25, 30)**  
  → Could leave files unclosed or corrupt on failure.  
   Switched to context-managed file access (`with open()`).

#### **Stylistic & Readability Improvements**
- Migrated from `%` formatting to **f-strings** for better readability.  
- Added **docstrings** for every function and class.  
- Broke long lines (> 79 chars) to follow **PEP 8**.  
- Removed redundant imports and trailing blank lines.


#### **Design & Architecture**
- Eliminated global variables (`stock_data`).  
- Refactored logic into a **class-based structure** for cleaner encapsulation.


###  Validation Summary

| Category    | Before | After |
|--------------|:------:|:-----:|
| Flake8 Warnings | 27 | 0 |
| Bandit Security Alerts | 3 | 0 |
| Unhandled Exceptions | Multiple | None |
| Documentation Coverage | Low | Full |

---

### Continuous Improvement

To keep the codebase consistent and secure:
- Implement **pre-commit hooks** (`flake8`, `bandit`, `pylint`).  
- Enforce **GitHub Actions** CI checks on every push.  
- Enable **auto-linting** in IDEs like VS Code for real-time feedback.
